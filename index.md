I am a PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering] [cse] at the [University of Washington] [uw], advised by [Luis Ceze] [luis] and [Mark Oskin] [oskin]. 

My current research is at the intersection of computer architecture and computational photography. In general, I am interested in using methodologies from architecture and systems design to improve the next generation of vision and graphics technologies. 

Before grad school, I studied [computer engineering] [cs@cu] and [English literature] [eng@cu] at [Columbia University] [cu]. Here's a [tech report] [schliere] I wrote about the Schlieren optics system I built during undergrad.
